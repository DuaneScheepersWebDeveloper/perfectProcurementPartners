Personal Mission Statement

PPP is an acronym for Perfect Procurement Partners and the meaning behind it is always customer based. The client comes first, always.
We are a procurement company that strives to deliver the best customer service possible to both our customers as well as our suppliers. We hold ourselves accountable to be able to deliver on promises that we make, and to act on behalf of our clients when it comes to supply. We negotiate on time lines, amounts payable as well as delivery times.
There are two partners Justin Harle and Jarred Michael who have very different backgrounds, but very much the same. We do understand that, that statement makes no sense, but the industries we have been in, have both been very customer focused for over 20 years.
Justin Harle has been in various industries but most recently he worked for Have2Need, which was a sourcing and supply company. We operated in the hospitality field where we worked with decorates, interior designers, architects as well as franchises. We also had custom made furniture suppliers so we were able to fulfil all the needs of the client.
Jarred Michael has been in retail for over 20 years. His most recent position was in home security as well turning homes into smart homes. In this position he worked with Architects as well interior designers and businesses. 
We know that companies as well as individuals can easily call suppliers, but as a company we will provide a service where we follow up on lead times, deliveries as well as installations. We act as the middleman and we are able to also supply services such as construction, plumbing and electrical. We will also negotiate with our suppliers on your behalf so that you are able to get the best price possible without losing out on any service.
PPP is aiming to be the only number you will need to call should you have a problem or need anything to be fixed.
